                    Dillon is guarenteed to burst out in song at least twice within a ten minute conversation. Nicknamed
                    "the jukebox", you never know which sentence you say may remind him of a song lyric. Also, be sure
                    to ask him about his Nick Jonas impression!

                    Dillon fills his time indulging in a slew of creative interests. He is a movie buff and pop culture
                    expert and hosts podcast entitled His Only Vice in which he discusses a film with a different friend
                    each episode.

                Despite being a goodball, Dillon takes the craft of acting quite seriously. He has an in-depth
                understanding of the theory behind good performance and will remind you, <em>"no one wants to see a
                    charcter <strong>being</strong> sad, that's boring. A character <strong>dealing</strong> with
                    saddness, on the other hand, is interesting."</em>

                Dillon is constantly exploring different avenues of creative expression. Such avenues include artsy
                photography as pictured on the left and writing comedy screenplays. Whatever it is, Dillon has a knack
                for making the mundane extraordinary!

                Staring as the titular character "the nerd" in a production of The Nerd, Dillon had the opportunity to
                let his silliness shine. He -- commented <em>"I was basically playing myself."</em> In one brilliant
                scene, Dillon's character was supposed to appear to be making up a game on the spot. To appear
                authentic, Dillon memorized no lines for this scene and actually made up the game during the scene each
                production.
