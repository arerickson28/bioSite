                    Dillon loves his friends and makes sure to let them know. His value for authentic, quality relationships is strong and he will take the risks required to bring these relationships into his life -- such as approaching a stranger who seems interesting and striking up a conversation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dillon is empathetic and listens to what you have to say. He has a strong ability to step into another's shoes while at the same time maintaining his own sense of self. Always respectful, if there is a disagreement he will say, <em> "I don't align but I do celebrate."</em>

                    As cliche as it sounds, Dillon is a citizen of the world. Travel is a major source of exploration and growth for Dillon. He takes the time to understand the world around him, employ critical thinking, and articualte himself well.

                <p>
                    Dillon is foodie and takes the opportunity to try new foods wherever he goes. And what better way to build relationships than over a good meal?

                    Get ready to laugh when you're around this guy. Dillon brings humor into his daily life. One time, when teasing his mother about the copious insperational quote decor plastored around the family home, he exclaimed, 
                    <em>"life is not a matter of 1, 2, 3, 4....it's more like cookie batter!"</em>
