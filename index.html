        Dillon McPherson is a 31 year old man with tremendous character. Having grown up in Vermont, he made his way to
        NYC and works for Apple. Dillon is very much a city person and loves being at the center of human culture and
        activity.

      <h3>What else?</h3>
      <p>
        Dillon is very smart and originally planned on majoring in biochemical engineering. Instead, he chose to follow
        his passion and majored in musical theatre with a minor in acting. Some people said he couldn't do it, that he
        couldn't get into the good acting schools because he hadn't been taking acting "seriously" all these years.
        However, Dillon, knowing himself well, trusted himself and made it happen.
